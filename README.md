-This web application gives real time stock buy/sell/don't buy or sell prediction based on news sentiment and historic stock price data.

-We have used the Bi-LSTM model on the company's historical price data and then we are passing the intraday price data which we are getting thourgh an API as a testing input to the model to give out the closing price.
